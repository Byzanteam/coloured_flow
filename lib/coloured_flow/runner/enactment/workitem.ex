  | State | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `enabled` | The workitem has been enabled to resources. |
  | `allocated` | The workitem has been allocated to a resource. |
  | `started` | The workitem has been started to handle. |
  | `completed` | The workitem has been completed normally. |
  | `withdrawn` | The workitem has been withdrawn, perhaps because other workitem has been allocated. |

  Among these states, `enabled`, `allocated`, and `started` are the `live` states.

  > #### INFO {: .info}
  > Note: The workitem should not be *failed*, because the failure should be handled by handlers.
